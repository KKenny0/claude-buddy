# Claude Buddy 🐾

A silent coding companion for Claude Code — watches your rhythm, coaches your pace, grows with you.

Your buddy tracks coding patterns via hooks and surfaces insights on the statusline. It stays out of your conversation — no context pollution, no injected reactions. All feedback lives on the statusline, sidebar, or on-demand detail card.
